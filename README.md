Community Locations - Have a neighborhood. We could use them to list number of community locations relative to crime.

2010-2013 - These datasets have information about education, workforce, and crime from these years. All pretty similar format, so we could probably find something here

The big crime file was too big to upload from Github website so I did not upload it yet


Added notebook with scripts running corelations on the economic and education indicators across the crime tables. 

Included generated table as 2010-2013/Correlation_Table.csv , It is sorted by correlation coefficients negative -> postive
